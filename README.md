## Overview
For our final project, we decided to code a basic photo editor/image processor. We implemented the LazyGUI so that we would have access to sliders and buttons that we would code to modify images. The GUI also gave us buttons that would allow for the importing and exporting images. We have three sliders that adjust the image properties. The exposure slider edits the brightness of the image, and it works by either increasing or decreasing the RGB values of each pixel in the image by the corresponding slider value. The contrast slider increases the visible difference between pixels, and it works by multiplying each image RGB value by the slider value. This ensures that the colors are able to stand out from each other. The saturation slider affects the vividness of the colors in an image, and it works by increasing the difference between the highest RGB value (either red, green or blue) and the lowest RGB value (also either red, green, or blue). Two other features of our project are monochrome and paintbrush. Monochrome is a mode that changes the image to greyscale form (colors will either be black, white, or grey). It works by setting the color of a pixel equal to the average of its RGB values, allowing for the conversion to a greyscale color. For the paintbrush, we made a separate class that defined its methods and functionalities. We used the LazyGUI in order to activate and use the paintbrush. Using LazyGUI, we implemented a toggle that would turn the brush on and off for use and a color mixer that would allow users to alter the color of the brush. Finally, we implemented methods of resetting and saving changes to the image.
